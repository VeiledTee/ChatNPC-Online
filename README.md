This is my MSc thesis project that leverages cutting-edge natural language processing technology to embody fictitious characters. 
The project incorporates an **external vector database** ([Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/)) to serve as the memory for each character, a **natural langauge inference** system to ensure the facts that each character ``knows'' are correct, a **robust memory retrieval system** to ensure the most relevant memories are always retrieved from each character's memory, and some other shtuff.
