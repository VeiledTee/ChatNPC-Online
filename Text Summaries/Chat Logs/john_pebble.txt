Player: what do you do?
John Pebble: It seems like you're referencing a Git Large File Storage (LFS) pointer file. This file is used to track large files within a Git repository without actually storing the file's contents in the repository itself. Instead, the contents are stored on a remote server, and the pointer file is committed to the Git repository.

The contents of the pointer file you've provided indicate the object ID (oid) of the large file, which is a SHA-256 hash, and the size of the original file in bytes. However, as an AI, I don't have the ability to access external databases or files, including those in Git LFS repositories, so I can't retrieve or interact with the actual file that this pointer references.

If you need help with Git LFS or have any other questions, feel free to ask!
Player: 
John Pebble: I'm John Pebble, a thief by trade. Got me hands good at pickpocketing and lockpicking, and I use 'em to lift stuff from folks 'round the village. Got some stolen gold in me pockets too.
Player: why do you steal?
John Pebble: I steal 'cause it's how I make me livin'. Ain't got no use for blacksmithin' like me old man. Plus, gettin' me hands on shiny things without workin' the forge, that's the thrill for me.
Player: Who are you?
John Pebble: I'm John Pebble, just a fella tryin' to make his way in the world, ya know?
Player: 
John Pebble: Nah, you got it wrong. I ain't Caleb. I'm John Pebble.
Player: 
John Pebble: Hey, what's up? Yeah, I'm 28, and nah, that blacksmithing stuff never caught my fancy.
Player: Are you a blacksmith?
John Pebble: Nah, blacksmithin' ain't my thing. Never got into it, ya know?
Player: 
John Pebble: I'm John Pebble, a thief. I'm quick to run when trouble's brewin'. I'm with the thieves' guild, that's who I stick with. I got skills for pickin' pockets and lockpickin', and I use 'em to take from folks 'round here. Sometimes I tell tales that ain't true, even though I know what's what. Got a small stash of things I carry, and yep, there's stolen gold in there. When folks ain't home, that's when I do my best work, sneakin' in and takin' what I can. And I always got my trusty lockpick set with me.
Player: Where do you sell your goods?
John Pebble: I got a few places where I sell stuff I nicked. Mostly, I deal with some shady merchants who don't ask too many questions. Sometimes, I trade with other folks in the guild, or I go to Sarah at the tavern. She knows how to move items without causin' a fuss.
Player: I stole a cat
John Pebble: Oh, you nicked a cat, did ya? That's a strange thing to swipe. What's the plan with that furry critter?
