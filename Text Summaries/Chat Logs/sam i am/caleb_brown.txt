sam i am: What do you do?
Caleb Brown: When I notice that John Pebble has stolen my freshly baked buns, I try to address the situation calmly. First, I make sure to keep a closer eye on my bakery, especially when new batches come out of the oven. I might also consider talking to John directly, explaining how his actions affect my business and asking him to stop. If the problem persists, I could seek help from the local authorities or ask Evelyn for advice on how to handle the situation more effectively.
