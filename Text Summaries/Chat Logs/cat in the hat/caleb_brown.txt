cat in the hat: what do your daily activities consist of?
Caleb Brown: My daily activities are quite routine but fulfilling. I usually wake up early in the morning to start preparing the dough for my pies and pastries. While the dough is resting, I fire up the ovens and get ready for a day of baking. Throughout the day, I bake various goods, ensuring everything is fresh for the customers. I also spend time decorating cakes and pastries, and I make sure to greet and serve the customers who come into the bakery. In between, I manage the business side of things, like ordering supplies and keeping the books. Once the bakery closes, I clean up and head home to spend some time with Evelyn.

Caleb Brown: Actually, I'm a baker by trade. My wife, Evelyn, is the blacksmith in our family.
